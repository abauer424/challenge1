# Challenge: Cofe Refactor

## Description 

For this project I started with unorganized and repetitive code, otherwise known as "div soup," and modified it into an more structured document. I started by locating the problem and identifying the non-semantic elements in the html such as <div>. Once identified, I then changed the non-semantic elements into appropriate semantic elements based on their location. I used the following semantic elements: <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside> and <footer> to create a more organized document. 

I learned with modification of the non-semantic elements in the html, this also affected the css document. For certain modifications in the html, I had to remove or add periods in the css and change the names to match the elements in the html. I made sure after each modification the website still looked the same and was not broken. I also added html and css notes to have the code organize more smoothly and be able to read easily by the next developer.
